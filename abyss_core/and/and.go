// and (Abyss Neighbor Discovery) algorithm defines worlds in abyss network.
// A World is created by OpenWorld or JoinWorld call on AND, which is the algorithm provider.
// Calling world writes back events synchronously.
// World algorithm may request a peer through event.
// On host-side event consumer prvides peer (by dialing or just giving connected peer).
// When a peer closes, the host calls PeerClose() to each world that references the peer.
// By this way, the host has full control over peer references.
